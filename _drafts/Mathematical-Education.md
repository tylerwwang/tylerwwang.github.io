## Introduction

Mathematics is a subject that is hated by students almost universally.
It generally has a reputation for being hard and abstract, and few see the purpose of it in their future lives.
This is a shame since, as it turns out, mathematics encapsulates our lives in more ways than one might think.
Everything on our phones, including the browser that you might be reading this from, is made possible by the advancements in mathematics and logic.
But to this point, with the development of computers, what purpose is there to teach our children math when many of the problems that we force our children to solve in schools can be solved in a fraction of a second by a computer?

If you were to ask any mathematician the question, "What is math?" you might get a variety of answers, but one thing that it is *not* is memorizing formulas and repetitive computation.
While memorizing formulas can aid a mathematician in hastening their work, and computation can help uncover some truths not otherwise obvious, most *real* mathematician don't prides themselves on the speed at which they can perform raw computation or the number of digits of $\pi$ they can memorize.
With that being said, let's take a look at what modern math has evolved to be.

## Evolution of Mathematics
Before we can analyze modern mathematics, let's first take a look at what math once was.
Whilst notions of math have existed in many cultures throughout human history, we will start our story in ancient Greece, where their advancements are the most well-documented in the Western world.
This time predated the invention of Arabic numerals, and so the math looked quite different from what we might be used to today.
Nonetheless, they were able to work with numbers.
Mathematicians at this time only  dealt with whole numbers since their number system has close ties to geometry.
In fact multiplication and addition where given geometric interpetations
With this, came the rational numbers, which are just ratios of whole numbers and many ancient mathematicians began to postulate that every constructable quantity could be in represented as a rational.
We now know this to be false.

## Why Teach This Way
There are many theories for why math is taught the way it is, esspecially in America; I will provide what I beleive holds the most validty.

For a while now, it seems that our world has started to shift it's focus away from living simple lives, instead the world today seems to focus way more on efficientcy and optimizing everything as much as possible.
While this is great for economic prosperity, what this mindset lacks is the ability for people to live

For a while now, it seems that our education system has shifted it's goal from educating and inspiring young humans with the great acheivment's of man, and instead focusing on preparing our students for high paying jobs.
Whilst, this doesn't seem like a problem on it's own, to me, I think education is more than just preparing someone to make as much money as possible upon graduation.
Instead, I beleive the value of education is to allow students to devlop skills to help them throughout more aspects of life, than just a career and money.








Before we get any further, my criticisms are mostly targeted at the math curriculum in the US.
While I don’t believe math education in other countries is perfect, they will get a pass, at least for now, since I have little experience and overall knowledge of these structures. 
With that being said, having been a part of and worked with students in high schools throughout the US, there’s certainly lots to be desired when it comes to what can be done for our students.

With that being said, let's begin our analysis of the purpose of our education system.
But before we look at math curricula, we must ask ourselves what goals we want our education system to accomplish.
For this essay, I've narrowed it down to these goals:

1. Prepare students for future career paths.
2. Equip students with skills to help them make critical life decisions.
3. Expose students to different facets of human ingenuity.

While these are certainly not the only goals, many would agree that they are certainly some of the most important.


## What Do We Want Students to Take Away
