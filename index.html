	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		I'm currently a student in Mathematics and Physics, with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe through the tools of mathematics.
		From a young age, I've been bewildered by the mysteries of space and captivated by its stories.
		The idea that seemingly arbitrary equations have such powerful implications for the world we live in is baffling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of academia, I also enjoy music, whether that be playing it or going to see others perform it.
		Though very different, I feel these interests are inherently connected; somehow the rigor of mathematics is very much tied in with the "free-flowingness" of music and art.
		On this site, I've posted some works that best tell my story.

<div class="home-about-dis">
	<h1>Drawings in the Sand</h1>
	<p>
		Our life stories, the importance of which is no match for the wrath of the passage of time.
		Like drawings in sand, we admire them until we must go, where the tide, through the emptiness of the night, leaves nothing as if nothing has yet occurred, ready for the stories of another ...
	</p>
	<p>
		As in the poem "Ozymandias":
	</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">
		[...] <br/>
		My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br/>
		Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br/>
		Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
		Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br/>
		The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br/>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		&#8212 Percy Bysshe Shelley (1818)
