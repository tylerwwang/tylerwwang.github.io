# About

I'm a student of mathematics and physics with a deep passion for exploring the universe through the lens of mathematics. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by the mysteries of space and the stories it holds. What amazes me most is how abstract equations, completely detached from reality, can reveal profound truths about the world around us.

Over the years, topology has become one of my favorite fields in mathematics.
Initially, I was drawn to it as a tool for conceptualizing higher-dimensional spaces.
However, as I delved deeper into the field, I came to appreciate topology’s unexpected utility not just in mathematics but also in physics.

Recently, I’ve become interested in topology's applications in mathematical logic, specifically in the logic of semi-definite processes.
It turns out the set of semi-definite processes give rise to a sort of "space" which abide by the axioms of topology.
In a way, we can interpret these semi-definite processes as inherently geometric and can thus be analyzed as such.
However, I prefer the interpretation that semi-definite logic gives rise to topology, which, in turn, suggests that the geometric problems analyzed in a topological framework are actually reformulations of geometric problems in terms of semi-definite logic.

So on this topic of changing the world, in the fall of 2024, I had the wonderful opportunity of participating in a project that aimed to uncover the theoretical capabilities of quantum computing.
Whilst the first viable quantum computer is still possibly decades in the future, as humans, we can't help but be curious about its potential to transform the future.
This opportunity provided me with a great window into this field, that sat quite foreign to me, and an insight into what is to come in the future. -->

Outside of academia, I enjoy music — both playing it and watching others perform.
Though they seem very different, I believe these interests are inherently connected; somehow, the rigor of mathematics is deeply intertwined with the freedom of music and art. This may not be accidental, as beneath the apparent freedom of art lies a hidden assortment of structures and patterns that give it a very mathematical quality.
But perhaps, it could also be that beneath the rigor of mathematics, there exists a world of beauty and freedom—one that feels much more like art, than science ...

Accordingly, this site serves as a platform for sharing my work that best reflects my journey.

# Why Drawings in Sand

Our life stories through time are like drawings in sand, 
admired until we must go, where the tide, through the emptiness of the night,
removes everything once significant, ready for the tales of another ...

As in the poem "Ozymandias":

>[...]\
>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\
>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\
>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\
>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\
>The lone and level sands stretch far away.

--- Percy Bysshe Shelley (1818)
