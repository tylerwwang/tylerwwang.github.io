# About

I'm currently a student in Mathematics and Physics, with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe through the tools of mathematics.
From a young age, I've been bewildered by the mysteries of space and captivated by its stories.
The idea that seemingly arbitrary equations have such powerful implications for the world we live in is baffling.

Right now, I'm participating in a research project that strives to uncover the theoretical capabilities of quantum computing.
Although currently, the idea of quantum computing is still quite far in the future, but just like all those years ago,
even before the first viable computer was built, mathematicians were already uncovering the theoretical capabilities of the Turing machine.

Outside of academia, I also enjoy music, whether that be playing it or going to see others perform it.
Though very different, I feel these interests are inherently connected; somehow the rigor of mathematics is very much tied in with the "free-flowingness" of music and art.
On this site, I've posted some works that best tell my story.

# Why Drawings in Sand

Our life stories through time are like drawings in sand, 
admired until we must go, where the tide, through the emptiness of the night,
removes everything once significant, ready for the tales of another ...

As in the poem "Ozymandias":

>[...]\
>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\
>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\
>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\
>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\
>The lone and level sands stretch far away.

--- Percy Bysshe Shelley (1818)
